# UCSD_IEEE_QP_FALL18
IEEE Quarterly Project at UCSD

Welcome to the portfolio for the Quarterly Project I have completed at IEEE UC San Diego Branch.
It's a Smart Lighting Control System. It distinguishes betweeen human body and non human objects based on the Thermal IR Sensor.
It turns off lights automatically when there's no human in the room and turn them on when someone's coming.
And most importantly, everything is controlled from the mobile app through the Arduino Bluetooth module.
The system can also be shutted down and user is going to use a traditional switch to turn on/off the light, as we usually do.
The Manual Mode is useful when users want to watch a movie or just sleep right below the lights.
